# Universal Speech Assessment Model

This repository aims to collect all available speech asessment models with the github page including speech quality and intelligibility prediction models.

## Speech Quality Prediction Models
We collect both human-based and objective-based speech quality prediction model. 

### 1. Human-based Speech Quality Prediction 
### 1. A. MOS Prediction Model
- Dataset:  VCC2018
